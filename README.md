Whirlybird clone developed in Godot Engine. Uses the phone accelerometer to control movement of the character. 

Known Bugs:
  - It is possible to push moving platforms if the player collides with them at the peak of their jump.
  - Sometimes double the intended amount of platforms spawn at the start of the game.
